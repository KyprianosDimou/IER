#### 2. Methodological information

Data were collected during 2019 and 2020, for a week in each year. The participants were asked to wear the Omron fitness tracker for 10 hours per day, to calculate the amount of calories burned.

For the purpose of this study, Microsoft Excel Version 2104 was used.

The following Excel functions were used:

AVERAGE: to calculate the daily average amount of calories burned (mean value) of 2019 and 2020
STDEV.S: to calculate the standard deviation of the daily average amount of calories burned (mean value) of 2019 and 2020
NORM.DIST: to normalize the distribution of the daily average amount of calories burned, of each individual.


#### 3. Data specific information

The dataset includes:
